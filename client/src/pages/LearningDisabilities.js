            <h3>What are Learning Disabilities?</h3>
            <p>
              Learning disabilities are due to genetic and/or neurobiological factors that alter brain functioning in a manner which affects one or more cognitive processes related to learning. These processing problems can interfere with learning basic skills such as reading, writing and/or math.  They can also interfere with higher level skills such as organization, time planning, abstract reasoning, long or short term memory and attention.  It is important to realize that learning disabilities can affect an individual’s life beyond academics and can impact relationships with family, friends and in the workplace.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since difficulties with reading, writing and/or math are recognizable problems during the school years, the signs and symptoms of learning disabilities are most often diagnosed during that time.  However, some individuals do not receive an evaluation until they are in post-secondary education or adults in the workforce.  Other individuals with learning disabilities may never receive an evaluation and go through life, never knowing why they have difficulties with academics and why they may be having problems in their jobs or in relationships with family and friends.
            </p>
            <p>
              Learning disabilities should not be confused with learning problems which are primarily the result of visual, hearing, or motor handicaps; of intellectual disability; of emotional disturbance; or of environmental, cultural or economic disadvantages.
            </p>
            <p>
              Generally speaking, people with learning disabilities are of average or above average intelligence. There often appears to be a gap between the individual’s potential and actual achievement. This is why learning disabilities are referred to as “hidden disabilities”: the person looks perfectly “normal” and seems to be a very bright and intelligent person, yet may be unable to demonstrate the skill level expected from someone of a similar age.
            </p>
            <p>
              A learning disability cannot be cured or fixed; it is a lifelong challenge. However, with appropriate support and intervention, people with learning disabilities can achieve success in school, at work, in relationships, and in the community.
            </p>
            <p>
              Frequent signals of learning disorders, that parents should watch for in their child include the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Difficult understanding and following instructions</li>
              <li>Trouble remembering what someone just told him or her</li>
              <li>Fails to master, reading, spelling, writing, and/or math skills</li>
              <li>Difficulty telling right from left; difficulty identifying words or a tendency to reverse letters, words, or numbers</li>
              <li>Lacks coordination in walking, sports, or small activities such as holding a pencil or tying a shoelace</li>
              <li>Easily loses or misplaces homework, schoolbooks or other items</li>
              <li>Difficulty understanding the concept or time; is confused by "yesterday, today, tomorrow"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Children with specific learning disabilities are eligible for special services or accommodations at school under the <a href="https://sites.ed.gov/idea/" target="blank">Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)</a> and the anti-discrimination law know as <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/504faq.html" target="blank">Section 504</a>.

              “Learning Disabilities” is an “umbrella” term describing a number of other, more specific learning disabilities, such as dyslexia and dysgraphia. Find the signs and symptoms of each, plus strategies to help below.
            </p>
            <h4>Types of Learning Disabilities</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Dyscalculia:</strong> Affects a person's ability to understand numbers and learn math facts. Individuals with this type of learning disability demonstrate impaired math calculation skills and difficulty understanding numbers and math facts. Dyscalculia is associated with weaknesses in fundamental number representation and processing, which results in difficulties with quantifying sets without counting, using nonverbal processes to complete simple numerical operations, and estimating relative magnitudes of sets. Because these math skills are necessary for higher-level math problem solving, quantitative reasoning is likely impaired for these individuals.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Dysgraphia:</strong> Affects a person’s handwriting ability and fine motor skills. Dysgraphia is a learning disability which involves impaired ability to produce legible and automatic letter writing and often numeral writing, the latter of which may interfere with math. Dysgraphia is rooted in difficulty with storing and automatically retrieving letters and numerals. Individuals with dysgraphia often have difficulties in Executive Functions (e.g., planning and organizing).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Dyslexia:</strong> Affects reading and related language-based processing skills. Dyslexia is characterized by deficits in accurate and fluent word recognition. Individuals with dyslexia struggle with word recognition, decoding, and spelling. Reading comprehension is sometimes impaired due to very poor word reading skills. Individuals with dyslexia often have deficits in phonemic and phonological awareness, which refer to the ability to hear, identify and manipulate the sound structure of a spoken word, including its phonemes, syllables, onsets and rimes. Individuals with dyslexia may also have impaired orthographic processing, which interferes with connecting letters and letter combinations with sounds accurately and fluently.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Non-Verbal Learning Disabilities</strong> Has trouble interpreting nonverbal cues like facial expressions or body language and may have poor coordination. Currently non-verbal learning disabilities are not listed in IDEA or the DSM-5 as a specific type of learning disability. There is a developing body of research that indicates approximately 5 percent of individuals with learning disabilities display the cognitive and academic difficulties that are associated with nonverbal learning disabilities. Research indicates that nonverbal learning disabilities are associated with impairment in three broad areas, including motoric skills, visual-spatial organizational memory, and social abilities. Individuals with this type of learning disability have a well-developed vocabulary, as well as strong reading recognition ability and rote language skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Oral / Written Language Disorder and Specific Reading Comprehension Deficit</strong> Affects an individual’s understanding of what they read or of spoken language. Individuals with Oral / Written Language Disorder and Specific Reading Comprehension Deficit struggle with understanding and/or expressing language often in both oral and written forms. These individuals often exhibit Specific Language Impairment related to deficits in semantic processing and syntactic processing. Semantic processing relates to encoding the meaning of words. Syntactic processing relates to the understanding of the order of words and how that can change meaning. For example, the sentences “The blanket is on the baby” and “The baby is on the blanket” use the same words, but have different meanings.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>ADHD:</strong> Affects focus, attention and behavior and can make learning challenging. A disorder that includes difficulty staying focused and paying attention, difficulty controlling behavior and hyperactivity. Although ADHD is not considered a learning disability, research indicates that from 30-50 percent of children with ADHD also have a specific learning disability, and that the two conditions can interact to make learning extremely challenging. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is a condition that becomes apparent in some children in the preschool and early school years. It is hard for these children to control their behavior and/or pay attention. It is estimated that between 3 and 5 percent of children have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or approximately 2 million children in the United States. This means that in a classroom of 24 to 30 children, it is likely that at least one will have ADHD. ADHD is not considered to be a learning disability. It can be determined to be a disability under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), making a student eligible to receive special education services. However, ADHD falls under the category “Other Health Impaired” and not under “Specific Learning Disabilities.” Individuals with ADHD can also qualify for accommodations under the ADA and Section 504 if their ADHD impacts a major life function such as learning. Many children with ADHD – approximately 20 to 30 percent – also have a specific learning disability. The principle characteristics of ADHD are inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. There are three subtypes of ADHD recognized by professionals. These are the predominantly hyperactive/impulsive type (that does not show significant inattention); The predominantly inattentive type (that does not show significant hyperactive-impulsive behavior) sometimes called ADD; and the combined type (that displays both inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms). Other disorders that sometimes accompany ADHD are Tourette Syndrome (affecting a very small proportion of people with ADHD); oppositional defiant disorder (affecting as many as one-third to one-half of all children with ADHD); conduct disorder (about 20 to 40% of ADHD children); anxiety and depression; and bipolar disorder.

            <p>
              <strong>Dyspraxia:</strong> A disorder that is characterized by difficulty in muscle control, which causes problems with movement and coordination, language and speech, and can affect learning. Although not a learning disability, Dyspraxia often exists along with Dyslexia, Dyscalculia or ADHD.

              <li>Make sure the parent knows about what is observed about the student in the classroom</li>
              <li>Refer student for occupational therapy or sensory integration training</li>
              <li>Be cognizant of light and light sources that may be irritating to child</li>
              <li>Use manipulatives, but make sure they are in students field of vision and don’t force student to touch them</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Executive Functioning:</strong> Affects planning, organization, strategizing, attention to details and managing time and space. An inefficiency in the cognitive management systems of the brain that affects a variety of neuropsychological processes such as planning, organization, strategizing, paying attention to and remembering details, and managing time and space. Although not a learning disability, different patterns of weakness in executive functioning are almost always seen in the learning profiles of individuals who have specific learning disabilities or ADHD.
            </p>
            <h5>Treatment for learning disorders</h5>
            <p>
              Children with learning disorders often need extra help and instruction that are specialized for them. Having a learning disorder can qualify a child for special education services in school. Schools usually do their own testing for learning disorders to see if a child needs intervention. An evaluation by a healthcare professional is needed if there are other concerns about the child’s behavior or emotions. Parents, healthcare providers, and the school can work together to find the right referrals and treatment.
