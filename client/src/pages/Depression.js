            <h3>Depression</h3>
            <p>
              Depression (major depressive disorder or clinical depression) is a common but serious mood disorder. It causes severe symptoms that affect how you feel, think, and handle daily activities, such as sleeping, eating, or working. To be diagnosed with depression, the symptoms must be present for at least two weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some forms of depression are slightly different, or they may develop under unique circumstances, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Persistent depressive disorder</strong> (also called dysthymia) is a depressed mood that lasts for at least two years. A person diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder may have episodes of major depression along with periods of less severe symptoms, but symptoms must last for two years to be considered persistent depressive disorder.</li>
              <li><strong><a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/perinatal-depression/index.shtml" target="blank">Postpartum depression</a></strong> is much more serious than the “baby blues” (relatively mild depressive and anxiety symptoms that typically clear within two weeks after delivery) that many women experience after giving birth. Women with postpartum depression experience full-blown major depression during pregnancy or after delivery (postpartum depression). The feelings of extreme sadness, anxiety, and exhaustion that accompany postpartum depression may make it difficult for these new mothers to complete daily care activities for themselves and/or for their babies.</li>
              <li><strong>Psychotic depression</strong> occurs when a person has severe depression plus some form of psychosis, such as having disturbing false fixed beliefs (delusions) or hearing or seeing upsetting things that others cannot hear or see (hallucinations). The psychotic symptoms typically have a depressive “theme,” such as delusions of guilt, poverty, or illness.</li>
              <li><strong><a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/seasonal-affective-disorder/index.shtml" target="blank">Seasonal affective disorder</a></strong> is characterized by the onset of depression during the winter months, when there is less natural sunlight. This depression generally lifts during spring and summer. Winter depression, typically accompanied by social withdrawal, increased sleep, and weight gain, predictably returns every year in seasonal affective disorder.</li>
              <li><strong><a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/bipolar-disorder/index.shtml" target="blank">Bipolar disorder</a></strong> is different from depression, but it is included in this list is because someone with bipolar disorder experiences episodes of extremely low moods that meet the criteria for major depression (called “bipolar depression”). But a person with bipolar disorder also experiences extreme high – euphoric or irritable – moods called “mania” or a less severe form called “hypomania.”</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Examples of other types of depressive disorders newly added to the diagnostic classification of <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm" target="blank">DSM-5</a> include disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (diagnosed in children and adolescents) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).
            </p>
            <h5>Signs and Symptoms</h5>
            <p>
              If you have been experiencing some of the following signs and symptoms most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks, you may be suffering from depression:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Persistent sad, anxious, or “empty” mood</li>
              <li>Feelings of hopelessness, or pessimism</li>
              <li>Irritability</li>
              <li>Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness</li>
              <li>Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities</li>
              <li>Decreased energy or fatigue</li>
              <li>Moving or talking more slowly</li>
              <li>Feeling restless or having trouble sitting still</li>
              <li>Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions</li>
              <li>Difficulty sleeping, early-morning awakening, or oversleeping</li>
              <li>Appetite and/or weight change</li>
              <li>Thoughts of death or suicide, or suicide attempts</li>
              <li>Aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems without a clear physical cause and/or that do not ease even with treatment</li>
              <li><strong>Suicide attempts or thoughts of death or suicide</strong></li>
            </ul>
              <div className="note">
                <p>
                <strong>If you or someone you know is in immediate distress or is thinking about hurting themselves,</strong> call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline toll-free at 1-800-273-TALK (8255) or the toll-free TTY number at 1-800-799-4TTY (4889). You also can text the Crisis Text Line (HELLO to 741741).
                </p>

              <br/>          
            <p>
              Not everyone who is depressed experiences every symptom. Some people experience only a few symptoms while others may experience many. Several persistent symptoms in addition to low mood are required for a diagnosis of major depression, but people with only a few – but distressing – symptoms may benefit from treatment of their “subsyndromal” depression. The severity and frequency of symptoms and how long they last will vary depending on the individual and his or her particular illness. Symptoms may also vary depending on the stage of the illness.
            </p>
            <h5>How is depression diagnosed?</h5>
            <p>
              To be diagnosed with depression, an individual must have five depression symptoms every day, nearly all day, for at least 2 weeks. One of the symptoms must be a depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure in almost all activities. Children and adolescents may be irritable rather than sad.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you think you may have depression, talk to your health care provider. Primary care providers routinely diagnose and treat depression and refer individuals to mental health professionals, such as psychologists or psychiatrists.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the visit, your provider may ask when your symptoms began, how long they last, how often they occur, and if they keep you from going out or doing your usual activities. It may help to make some notes about your symptoms before your visit. Certain medications and some medical conditions, such as viruses or a thyroid disorder, can cause the same depression symptoms. Your provider can rule out these possibilities by doing a physical exam, interview, and lab tests.
            </p>
            <h5>Does depression look the same in everyone?</h5>
            <p>
              Depression can affect people differently, depending on their age.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Children</strong> with depression may be anxious, cranky, pretend to be sick, refuse to go to school, cling to a parent, or worry that a parent may die.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Older children and teens</strong> with depression may get into trouble at school, sulk, be easily frustrated‚ feel restless, or have low self-esteem. They also may have other disorders, such as anxiety and eating disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or substance use disorder. Older children and teens are more likely to experience excessive sleepiness (called hypersomnia) and increased appetite (called hyperphagia). In adolescence, females begin to experience depression more often than males, likely due to the biological, life cycle, and hormonal factors unique to women.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Younger adults</strong> with depression are more likely to be irritable, complain of weight gain and hypersomnia, and have a negative view of life and the future. They often have other disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, panic disorder, and substance use disorders.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Middle-aged adults</strong> with depression may have more depressive episodes, decreased libido, middle-of-the-night insomnia, or early morning awakening. They also may more frequently report having gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea or constipation.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Older adults</strong> with depression commonly experience sadness or grief or may have other less obvious symptoms. They may report a lack of emotions rather than a depressed mood. Older adults also are more likely to have other medical conditions or pain that may cause or contribute to depression. In severe cases, memory and thinking problems (called pseudodementia) may be prominent.
            </p>    

            <h5>Risk Factors</h5>
            <p>
              Depression is one of the most common mental disorders in the U.S. Current research suggests that depression is caused by a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Depression can happen at any age, but often begins in adulthood. Depression is now recognized as occurring in children and adolescents, although it sometimes presents with more prominent irritability than low mood. Many chronic mood and anxiety disorders in adults begin as high levels of anxiety in children.
            </p>
            <p>
              Depression, especially in midlife or older adults, can co-occur with other serious medical illnesses, such as diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and Parkinson’s disease. These conditions are often worse when depression is present. Sometimes medications taken for these physical illnesses may cause side effects that contribute to depression. A doctor experienced in treating these complicated illnesses can help work out the best treatment strategy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Risk factors include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Personal or family history of depression</li>
              <li>Major life changes, trauma, or stress</li>
              <li>Certain physical illnesses and medications</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Treatment and Therapies</h5>
            <p>
              Depression, even the most severe cases, can be treated. The earlier that treatment can begin, the more effective it is. Depression is usually treated with <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications/index.shtml" target="blank">medications</a>, <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies/index.shtml" target="blank">psychotherapy</a>, or a combination of the two. If these treatments do not reduce symptoms, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and other brain stimulation therapies may be options to explore.
            </p>
            <div className="note">
              <p>
                <strong>Quick Tip:</strong> No two people are affected the same way by depression and there is no "one-size-fits-all" for treatment. It may take some trial and error to find the treatment that works best for you.
              </p>
            </div>
            <h5>Medications</h5>
            <p>
              Antidepressants are medicines that treat depression. They may help improve the way your brain uses certain chemicals that control mood or stress. You may need to try several different antidepressant medicines before finding the one that improves your symptoms and has manageable side effects. A medication that has helped you or a close family member in the past will often be considered.
            </p>
            <p>
              Antidepressants take time – usually 2 to 4 weeks – to work, and often, symptoms such as sleep, appetite, and concentration problems improve before mood lifts, so it is important to give medication a chance before reaching a conclusion about its effectiveness. If you begin taking antidepressants, do not stop taking them without the help of a doctor. Sometimes people taking antidepressants feel better and then stop taking the medication on their own, and the depression returns. When you and your doctor have decided it is time to stop the medication, usually after a course of 6 to 12 months, the doctor will help you slowly and safely decrease your dose. Stopping them abruptly can cause withdrawal symptoms.
            </p>
            <div className="note">
              <p>
                <strong>Please Note:</strong> In some cases, children, teenagers, and young adults under 25 may experience an increase in suicidal thoughts or behavior when taking antidepressants, especially in the first few weeks after starting or when the dose is changed. This warning from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also says that patients of all ages taking antidepressants should be watched closely, especially during the first few weeks of treatment.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are considering taking an antidepressant and you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding, talk to your doctor about any increased health risks to you or your unborn or nursing child.
              </p>
              <p>

            <p>
              You may have heard about an herbal medicine called St. John's wort. Although it is a top-selling botanical product, the FDA has not approved its use as an over-the-counter or prescription medicine for depression, and there are serious concerns about its safety (it should never be combined with a prescription antidepressant) and effectiveness. Do not use St. John’s wort before talking to your health care provider. Other natural products sold as dietary supplements, including omega-3 fatty acids and S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), remain under study but have not yet been proven safe and effective for routine use.

            </p>
            <h5>Psychotherapies</h5>
            <p>
              Several types of psychotherapy (also called “talk therapy” or, in a less specific form, counseling) can help people with depression. Examples of evidence-based approaches specific to the treatment of depression include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), and problem-solving therapy.
            </p>
            <h5>Brain Stimulation Therapies</h5>
            <p>
              If medications do not reduce the symptoms of depression, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be an option to explore. Based on the latest research:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>ECT can provide relief for people with severe depression who have not been able to feel better with other treatments.</li>
              <li>Electroconvulsive therapy can be an effective treatment for depression. In some severe cases where a rapid response is necessary or medications cannot be used safely, ECT can even be a first-line intervention.</li>
              <li>Once strictly an inpatient procedure, today ECT is often performed on an outpatient basis. The treatment consists of a series of sessions, typically three times a week, for two to four weeks.</li>
              <li>ECT may cause some side effects, including confusion, disorientation, and memory loss. Usually these side effects are short-term, but sometimes memory problems can linger, especially for the months around the time of the treatment course. Advances in ECT devices and methods have made modern ECT safe and effective for the vast majority of patients. Talk to your doctor and make sure you understand the potential benefits and risks of the treatment before giving your informed consent to undergoing ECT.</li>
              <li>ECT is not painful, and you cannot feel the electrical impulses. Before ECT begins, a patient is put under brief anesthesia and given a muscle relaxant. Within one hour after the treatment session, which takes only a few minutes, the patient is awake and alert.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Other more recently introduced types of brain stimulation therapies used to treat medicine-resistant depression include repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Other types of brain stimulation treatments are under study. You can learn more about these therapies on the <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/brain-stimulation-therapies/brain-stimulation-therapies.shtml" target="blank">NIMH Brain Stimulation Therapies</a> webpage.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you think you may have depression, start by making an appointment to see your doctor or health care provider. This could be your primary care practitioner or a health provider who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions.

            <h5>Beyond Treatment: Things You Can Do</h5>
            <p>
              Here are other tips that may help you or a loved one during treatment for depression:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Try to be active and exercise.</li>
              <li>Set realistic goals for yourself.</li>
              <li>Try to spend time with other people and confide in a trusted friend or relative.</li>
              <li>Try not to isolate yourself, and let others help you.</li>
              <li>Expect your mood to improve gradually, not immediately.</li>
              <li>Postpone important decisions, such as getting married or divorced, or changing jobs until you feel better. Discuss decisions with others who know you well and have a more objective view of your situation.</li>
              <li>Continue to educate yourself about depression.</li>
            </ul>
