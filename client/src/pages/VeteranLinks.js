            <h5>Common questions Veterans have when seeking mental health services</h5>
            <br/>
            <p>
              <strong>Will using mental health services at the VA put my career at risk?</strong>
            </p>
            <p> 
              Being diagnosed with a mental health condition or seeking mental health care doesn’t automatically put work-related credentials, such as security clearances, at risk. Most employers recognize that healthy employees who get help when they need it are more productive and effective in their jobs than those who aren’t performing at their best because they’re not feeling well.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Do I need to be enrolled in VA health care to access mental health care?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              No. If you don’t qualify for VA health care, you may still be able to get certain health care services, like care for needs linked to military sexual trauma.
            </p>
            <p>
              Call the general VA hotline at 800-827-1000 to find out what your care options may be. Hours of Operation: Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. ET.
            </p>
            <p>
              Depending on your needs and situation, you can also:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Get free private counseling, alcohol and drug assessment, and other support for combat Veterans and families at one of our 300 community Vet Centers.<br /> <a href="https://www.va.gov/find-locations/?facilityType=vet_center" target="blank">Find a Vet Center near you</a></li>
              <li>Contact the National Call Center for Homeless Veterans at <strong>877-424-3838</strong> for help 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. A trained VA counselor will offer information about VA homelessness programs, health care, and other services in your area. The call is free and confidential.</li>
              <li>Call or visit your local VA Community Resource and Referral Center. Even if you don’t qualify for VA health care, our staff can help you find non-VA resources you may qualify for in your community.<br /><a href="https://www.va.gov/HOMELESS/Crrc.asp" target="blank">Find your local Community Resource and Referral Center</a></li>

            </p>
            <p>
              You’ll start receiving help the day you reach out to them. They offer same-day services to make sure we can either address your mental health needs or schedule the right follow-up care right away. The specific care you receive will depend on how urgent your needs are and the level of treatment you’re looking for.
            </p>
            <p>
              Same-day services may include care such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
